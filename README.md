## About the Project

The **MomentX Course Registration Portal** is a simulated university registration system that mimics real-world academic portals. Students can:

- Log in securely
- Explore semester-wise curriculum
- Choose their school and branch
- Register for courses within a defined credit limit
- Receive confirmation and summaries of registered subjects

The project demonstrates interactive front-end design, form validation, and basic dynamic behavior without a backend.
